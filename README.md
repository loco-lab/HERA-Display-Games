Games to be played on the HERA display


## How to run our test scripts
The environment on the pi is really weird...

`source ~/Hera_games_env/bin/activate`

To run simple scripted movement:

`sudo /home/hera-led/Hera_games_env/bin/python scripts/test_movement.py`

`sudo /home/hera-led/Hera_games_env/bin/python muck_around/test_controler_input.py`
